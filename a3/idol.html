    <h2>Early life and Education</h2>
    <p>Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. 
        His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, 
        but raised in South Africa.he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid 
        mandatory service in the South African military.In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.
         Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania; he graduated in 1995 with a Bachelor of Science
          degree in economics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics.</p>
    
    <h2>Business career</h2>
    <p>In 1995, Musk, Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds from angel investors.
        The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and
        yellow pages.Musk's attempts to become CEO, a position held by its Chairman Rich Sorkin, were thwarted by the board. Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.In 1999, Musk co-founded
        X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company. The startup was one of the first federally insured online banks, and,
        within its initial months, over 200,000 customers joined the service.In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society. 
        He was inspired by plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars and discussed funding the project himself. Musk founded Space 
        Exploration Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX, in May 2002. As of 2021, he remains the company's CEO and also holds the title of 
        Chief Engineer.SpaceX attempted their first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006, and although the rocket failed to reach Earth 
        orbit, they were awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA later that year.
         After two more failed attempts, which reportedly caused Musk so much stress that he was "waking from nightmares, 
         screaming and in physical pain," SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008, making it the first 
         private liquid-fuel rocket to do so. Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services program 
         contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the 
         Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became
          the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.As of 2019, Elon Musk is the longest tenured CEO of any 
          automotive manufacturer globally.
